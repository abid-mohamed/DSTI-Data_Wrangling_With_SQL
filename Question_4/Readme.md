## Question 4 :
In the database WideWorldImporters, write a SQL query which reports the highest loss of money from orders not being converted into invoices, by customer category. The name and id of the customer who generated this highest loss must also be identi{ed. The resultset is ordered by highest loss. <br />
You should be able to write it in pure SQL, but if too challenging, you may use T-SQL and cursors. <br />
